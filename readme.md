## Gps project
This project works with gps data from a gps device. It is a simple project to show how to use the gps device and how to use the gps data.

### Environment
Create a ```env.json``` file in the root directory of the project. The file should contain the following:
```json
{
  "ssid": "ssid",
  "password": "password",
  "server_url": "http://server_url:port",
}
```
This is only needed if you want to connect to a wifi network.
